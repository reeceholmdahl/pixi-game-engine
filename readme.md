# Game Engine written in JS with pixi.js

Due to a recent injury I've found myself with a lot of free time. I decided to use this time to experiment with something I've always wanted to: making a game. I've been working quite consistently at a few tech demos and making iterative progress on my physics engine and rendering wrapper for **pixi.js** and decided to upload it to Github as a sort of marker of my progress.

Anyway, I'll be updating this quite frequently as I make progress on the engine. Maybe I'll flush out this readme a little more, who knows. For now a few extemporaneous goals I have as of now are: consistent AABB vs. AABB collisions (pretty sure I'm there but only playtests will tell), a modular engine design allowing me to easily build with a good system as opposed to _around_ a bad system, eventually server connectivity and a data-streaming interface. Hefty goals for my first attempt, and for raw javascript with no types... (I come from Java) Wish me luck!
